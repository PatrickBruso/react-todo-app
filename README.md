## About

This project is a recreation of the CSSG Lab's [Flask Todo App](https://github.com/CSSG-Labs/flask-todo-app/tree/main) but written using the MERN stack instead of a Flask backend.  The front end will be converted to React and the backend will be implemented using Node and Express, with a MongoDB database.
